\begin{defn}{Limit point of a set}{limitpoint}
	Let \(X\) be a metric space. Given a set \(A \subset X\), we say that seme point \(x \in X\) is a \emph{limit point \(A\)} if, for all  \(\epsilon > 0\), the neighborhood \(V_\epsilon(x)\) intersects \(A\) at some point other than \(x\).
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{Closed set}{closed}
	Let \(X\) be a metric space.
	We say that \(A \subset X\) is closed if every limit point of \(F\) is an element of \(F\).
\end{defn}
