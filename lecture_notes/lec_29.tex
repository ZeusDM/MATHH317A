\begin{thm}{}{}
	Given a function \(f\colon X \to Y\), \(f\) is continuous on \(X\) if, and only if, for all open sets \(O \subset Y\), the preimage \(f^{-1}(O)\) is an open set in \(X\).
\end{thm}

\begin{defn}{}{}
	We say that a set \(S \subset A \subset X\) is relatively open with respect to \(A\) (or, simply, open in \(A\)) if there exists an open set \(O\) in \(X\) so that \(S = O \cap A\).
\end{defn}
